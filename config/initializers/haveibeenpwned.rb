# config/initializers/haveibeenpwned.rb

# This initializer is used to configure any global settings or constants
# related to the Have I Been Pwned API integration.

# You can set global variables, constants, or even configure third-party services here.
# Since we're directly making HTTP requests to the Have I Been Pwned API in the service,
# there's no need for additional configuration at this point.

# However, if in the future we decide to use a gem or a more complex setup,
# this would be the place to initialize that configuration.

# For now, this file is intentionally left blank as our current implementation
# of the PasswordCheckService does not require any additional configuration.
